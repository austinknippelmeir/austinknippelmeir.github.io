As you can see above they were far from the worst in either category. Which again begs the question; why were they so terrible?\n\n\nCode\nplayoffs <- NYK %>% filter(season == 1994 | season == 1995 | season == 1980 | season == 1982 | season == 1983 | season == 1987 | season == 1988 | season == 1989 | season == 1990 | season == 1991 | season == 1992 | season == 1993 | season == 1996 | season == 1997 | season == 1998 | season == 1999 | season == 2000 | season == 2003 | season == 2010 | season == 2011 | season == 2012 | season == 2020)\n\nbad <- NYK %>% filter(season == 2019)\n\nggplot() + geom_bar(data=NYK, aes(x=season, weight=w),fill=\"grey\") +\n   geom_bar(data=playoffs, aes(x=season, weight=w),fill=\"blue\") +\n   geom_bar(data=bad, aes(x=season, weight=w),fill=\"orange\") +\n   labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Wins\", \n    title=\"Knicks used to be good\", \n    subtitle=\"The Knicks are literally bad for your mental health, stop watching them.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Data Provider | By Austin K\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nOn this chart the win totals from all the Knicks teams in the data are portrayed. This shows the long stretch of success for the Knicks from the late 80s into the early 2000s before a nosedive into mediocrity and depression for the once great team and their rabid fanbase. This shows how fast a solid foundation can crumble and wither into a team that made the playoffs only three times during the 2010s.\n\n\nCode\nNYK %>% filter(season!=2020) %>% top_n(10, wt=-w) %>% select(season, w, l, e_fg_percent) %>% gt() %>% \n cols_label(\n    e_fg_percent = \"Effective Field Goal Percentage\",\n    season = \"Season\",\n    w = \"W\",\n    l = \"L\"\n  ) %>%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Where the 2018-19 Knicks rank among the worst\",\n    subtitle = \"This will compare effective field goal percentage with the worst teams in Knicks history.\"\n  )  %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) %>%\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Austin Knippelmeir  |  **Source:** Basketball Reference\"))%>% \n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )) %>%\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"blue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"orange\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = season == \"2019\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Where the 2018-19 Knicks rank among the worst\n    \n    \n      This will compare effective field goal percentage with the worst teams in Knicks history.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Season\n      W\n      L\n      Effective Field Goal Percentage\n    \n  \n  \n    1985\n24\n58\n0.487\n    1986\n23\n59\n0.466\n    1987\n24\n58\n0.483\n    1999\n27\n23\n0.463\n    2006\n23\n59\n0.481\n    2008\n23\n59\n0.475\n    2010\n29\n53\n0.509\n    2015\n17\n65\n0.470\n    2018\n29\n53\n0.510\n    2019\n17\n65\n0.490\n  \n  \n    \n      By: Austin Knippelmeir  |  Source: Basketball Reference\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nEffective field goal percentage can be a valuable metric to see how efficient a team truly is offensively and for this Knicks team, theirs was not good. I took the 10 worst Knicks teams from 1980-2020, excluding 2020 which was a COVID-19 shortened season, and compared them to see where they each ranked against the others. We can see that it is not nearly the worst. Of course, offense has ticked up since some of these teams took the court and I do think that the era that these teams were pulled from do have a part to play in the confusion.\nOverall this has taught me one thing; the Knicks are their own anomaly. Looking at the stats, rankings and other pieces show that this Knicks team is far from the “worst” in franchise history looking at the statistics and analytics yet they sit alone at the top with the 2014-15 Knicks as the worst Knicks teams in their long history with a record of 17-65. Having watched these teams I can say I don’t understand either. What I do know is that the New York Knicks are tragic, very very tragic."

KDB sits in the top five with his 2018 season which was one of his best since donning a City shirt. Goals and assists are not the most important stat but for an attacking midfielder such as De Bruyne those are the results that you are looking for that come from the advanced stats which favor him over many of his peers.\nOverall with this project I set out to see if Kevin De Bruyne was the best midfielder in football and I feel that after comparing him to his midfield peers with a variety of stats that are especially important to midfielders that he is in fact the best midfielder in the world with all that he does at a high level. City’s success has been in no small part to the contributions of KDB and his consistent high level play during his time in a blue shirt."
